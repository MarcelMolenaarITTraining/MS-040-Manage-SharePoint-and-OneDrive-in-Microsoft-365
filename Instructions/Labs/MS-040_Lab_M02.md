# Module 02-Lab 1: Manage OneDrive
## Microsoft 365 user interface 

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you may experience user interface (UI) changes that were made following the development of this training content. This will manifest itself in UI changes that do not match up with the detailed instructions presented in this lab manual.

The Microsoft World-Wide Learning team will update this training course as soon as any such changes are brought to our attention. However, given the dynamic nature of cloud updates, you may run into UI changes before this training content is updated. **If this occurs, you will have to adapt to the changes and work through them in the lab exercises as needed.**

## Exercise 1: Manage OneDrive settings 

In this exercise you will complete multiple administrative tasks. You will assign all users to have a storage limit of 2TB, restrict certain file types from being synced and set limits on sharing. These administrative changes would be done typically prior to roll out of the sync app to users.

### Task 1: Set storage quota for all users

In this task, you will check the current storage quota for all users and then change to 2TB.

1.  Log on to **LON-CL1** virtual machine as the local administrator (Adatum\\administrator).

2.  Open **Edge** and browse to <https://portal.office.com>.

3.  Sign in to Microsoft 365
    
    1.  You should be presented a sign in dialog box, if you are directed to the page instead, select **Sign In** from the upper right of the page. If you are presented the sign in dialog box, **copy and paste the M365 Credential Username** into the box presented, select **Next**.
    
    2.  In the next screen, **copy and paste the M365 Credential Password** into the box presented, select **Sign In**.
    
    3.  When it asks if you would like to **Stay signed in?** then select **Yes** to stay signed in.

4.  In the Microsoft 365 landing page, select **Admin** to access **Microsoft 365 admin center.**

You have successfully changed the storage quota for all new users to 2 TB. Continue with the next task.

### Task 2: Restrict file types from being synced 

You need to restrict the sync client so that large files such as videos are not being synced. In this task you will add restrictions so that common video file formats are not synced.

1.  From the OneDrive admin center select **Sync** in the left navigation pane. This will open the sync settings page.

2.  Select the box for **Block syncing of specific file types**.

3.  In the text box enter the file extensions as shown below. Do not enter any punctuation such as a period with the entry. Enter each on its own line.
